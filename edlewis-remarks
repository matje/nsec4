Running commentary:


[MG: mee begonnen, zie "Experimental Status"]:, zie ook 1) hierboven

1) The document should state explicitly that this is an experimental 
effort.  There's no way that NSEC4 will unseat NSEC and NSEC3 and 
you'll get an earful from the trolls that will talk about this taking 
decade to even deploy and that by then DNSSEC will be firmly 
encrusted with the current mistakes in it.

3) I think that the scope, intent, questions being examined and when 
results are expected should be part of any experiment and thus any 
experimental document.  (I'm trying to push client-subnet to have the 
same section.)  If you clearly lay out that this is an experiment and 
the goals, you'll have an easier time fending off the trolls.  (They 
will bite, they always do.)

[MG: heb jij al gefixt?]:
4) I don't understand "wildcard synthesis is possible at the original 
owner name".  The first NSEC4 you would see is either owned by the 
qname (No error/no data) or the closest encloser (NXDOMAIN).  If it 
is the CE then the bit would mean that the CE has no descendent node 
named "*".  That's what you are after, right?  Then I'd reword the 
quotes to be "s/at the original owner name/because the owner name has 
no child node named \"*\\"/".

6) I began to skim a bit but caught this:

    [MM: Instead or returning the NSEC3 RR that covers the next closer,
    the server could have returned the NSEC3 RR that covers the QNAME in
    order to proof that there is no exact match for QNAME.]

I think you need the CE and the proof that the next closer one fails, 
not the CE and the QNAME fails.  Because there might by N (>0) labels 
between the CE and QNAME, you have to prove the CE asserted is really 
the closest you can get.

9) Comparing a bit field with an integer:

     7.2.  Verifying NSEC4 RRs

        A validator MUST ignore NSEC4 RRs with a Flag fields value greater
        than three.

You have to say this some other way.  It gets sticky because someone 
might use a 'int' of 64 bits to hold the 8 bit Flag fields, etc. 
Enforce that this is bitwise and say that 0xFC | flag field must be 0 
- or whatever it should be.

I didn't read the Appdx yet.  I wanted to get this response in first.

I think this is worth going forward with, as an experiment.  If NSEC4 
proves to be a worth while upgrade, we'd have to do a type code roll 
again and name this NSEC5.  If that happens, there's Nobel prizes for 
mathematics all around.  (You do know Nobel never instituted a math 
prize.)  Still, we can learn a lot by seeing NSEC4 side by side with 
the NSEC/NSEC3 world.
