Dear colleagues,

We (Matthijs Mekking and Miek Gieben) had a nagging feeling that NSEC3
was a sub optimal solution for providing authenticated denial of existence.

In particular:

* It uses an entire NSEC3 record (+ signature) for denying or asserting a wildcard;
* It does not provide Opt-Out of unhashed names.

Also RFC 5155 lacks a bit in providing background for some of the design decisions.

In an attempt to address these issues and provide additional insight in how NSEC and
NSEC3 work, we submitted the following draft:

    http://www.ietf.org/id/<draft>

Abstract:

> The Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Extensions introduced the NSEC
> resource record (RR) for authenticated denial of existence, and the NSEC3
> resource record for hashed authenticated denial of existence.  This document
> introduces an alternative resource record, NSEC4, which similarly provides 
> authenticated denial of existence. It permits gradual expansion of
> delegation-centric zones, just like NSEC3 does. 
> With NSEC4 it is possible, but not required, to provide 
> measures against zone enumeration.
> 
> NSEC4 reduces the size of the denial of existence response and
> adds Opt-Out to unhashed names.


Please send your comments/feedback to the list.

Thanks,
    Matthijs & Miek
