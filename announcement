Dear dnsext,

We have written down a little experiment that we have performed, called NSEC4.
The goal of the experiment was to optimize denial of existence records.
It is not our intention to standardize this, as we are aware of the backwards
compatibility issues this has with the current DNSSEC family RFC, and we do
not want to discomfort the ongoing DNSSEC deployment.

However, we do want to document this to archive the insights we have gained
by doing this experiment. Therefor, we have submitted the following draft:

    http://www.ietf.org/id/<draft>

This experiment resolves two things:
* Reduces the size of the denial of existence response;
* Adds Opt-Out to unhashed names.

We would be grateful if you would like to read this.

Our question is what is the best place to archive this? Re-reading RFC 2026,
we are considering to put this on the experimental non-standards track.

Thoughts?

Best regards,

Miek Gieben,
Matthijs Mekking
