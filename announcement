Dear colleagues,

For quite some time I've been working on a document that clarifies
NSEC3 (URL). This idea was born from the fact that I find RFC 5155
a bit lacking in providing background for some of the design decisions.

From this document grew the idea "this can be done more efficient".
In particular, NSEC3:

* uses an entire record (+ signature) for denying or asserting a wildcard;
* does not provide Opt-Out of unhashed names.

In an attempt to address these issues and provide additional insight in how NSEC and
NSEC3 work, we (Matthijs Mekking and Miek Gieben) submitted the following draft:

    http://www.ietf.org/id/<draft>

Abstract:

> The Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Extensions introduced the NSEC
> resource record (RR) for authenticated denial of existence, and the NSEC3
> resource record for hashed authenticated denial of existence.  This document
> introduces an alternative resource record, NSEC4, which similarly provides 
> authenticated denial of existence. It permits gradual expansion of
> delegation-centric zones, just like NSEC3 does. 
> With NSEC4 it is possible, but not required, to provide 
> measures against zone enumeration.
> 
> NSEC4 reduces the size of the denial of existence response and
> adds Opt-Out to unhashed names.

The draft is aimed at the experimental track. The code (ldns/NSD/GoDNS)
we use for our experiments uses the PRIVATEDNS algorithm (RFC 4034, Section A.1.1. and 
RFC 4955).

Please send your comments/feedback to the list.

Thanks,
    Matthijs & Miek
