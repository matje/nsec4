The Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Extensions introduced the NSEC
resource record (RR) for authenticated denial of existence, and the NSEC3
resource record for hashed authenticated denial of existence.  This document
introduces an alternative resource record, NSEC4, which similarly provides 
authenticated denial of existence.  It permits gradual expansion of
delegation-centric zones, just like NSEC3 does.  It is possible, but not
required, to provide measures against zone enumeration.
