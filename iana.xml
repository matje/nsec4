    Although the NSEC4 and NSEC4PARAM RR formats include a hash
    algorithm parameter, this document does not define a particular
    mechanism for safely transitioning from one NSEC4 hash algorithm to
    another. When specifying a new hash algorithm for use with NSEC4, a
    transition mechanism MUST also be defined.

    This document updates the IANA registry "DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM
    PARAMETERS" (http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters) in
    sub-registry "TYPES", by defining two new types.
    <xref target="the-nsec4-resource-record"/> defines the NSEC4
    RR type [TBD].
    <xref target="the-nsec4param-resource-record"/> defines the
    NSEC4PARAM RR type [TBD].
  </t>
  <t>
    This document possibly updates the IANA registry "DNS SECURITY
    ALGORITHM NUMBERS -- per <xref target="RFC4035"/>"
    (http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers).
  </t>

    This document creates a new IANA registry for NSEC4 flags. This
    registry is named "DNSSEC NSEC4 Flags". The initial
    contents of this registry are:
  </t>
  <figure><artwork>
  0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|    |    |    |    |    |    |Wild|Opt-|
|    |    |    |    |    |    |card|Out |
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

bit 6 is the Wildcard flag.

bit 7 is the Opt-Out flag.

bits 0 - 5 are available for assignment.

  <t>
    Assignment of additional NSEC4 Flags in this registry requires IETF
    Standards Action <xref target="RFC5226"/>.
  </t>

    This document creates a new IANA registry for NSEC4PARAM flags. This
    registry is named "DNSSEC NSEC4PARAM Flags". The initial
    contents of this registry are:
  </t>
  <figure><artwork>
  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 0 |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

bit 7 is reserved and must be 0.

bits 0 - 6 are available for assignment.

    Assignment of additional NSEC4PARAM Flags in this registry requires
    IETF Standards Action <xref target="RFC5226"/>.

    Finally, this document creates a new IANA registry for NSEC4 hash
    algorithms. This registry is named "DNSSEC NSEC4 Hash
    Algorithms". The initial contents of this registry are:
  </t>
  <figure><artwork>
0 is Zero hashing.

1 is SHA-1.

2-255 Available for assignment.

  <t>
    Assignment of additional NSEC4 hash algorithms in this registry
    requires IETF Standards Action <xref target="RFC5226"/>.
